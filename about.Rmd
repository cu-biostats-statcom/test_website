<h1> About the Columbia STATCOM Chapter </h1>

The Columbia STATCOM Chapter was founded in 2021 by [Maddie Stoms](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madison-stoms-597155127/), [Charly Fowler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-fowler-2a86b71a0/), Steven Lawrence, and [Muhire Kwizera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhire-honorine-kwizera-96253583/) with the help of faculty advisor [Cody Chiuzan](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cc3780). Our organization is inspired by the STATCOM chapter at the University of Michigan Department of Biostatistics ([link](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/statcom/index.html)).
